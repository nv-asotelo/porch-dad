"""Reachy Mini control for the porch-dad command centre.

Talks to the robot's own daemon REST API rather than proxying Home Assistant. HA's Reachy
integration exposes the same capabilities, but routing through it would make this page depend on
Home Assistant being up - and the command centre's job is to work when other things are off. The
camera preview already learned that lesson the hard way: it was wired to the Live VLM WebUI and
went dark whenever that was switched off to save load.

Everything here is a thin wrapper over documented daemon endpoints. Angles are degrees at this
boundary and radians on the wire, matching the robot's published limits.
