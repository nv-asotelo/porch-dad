"""Serve the Reachy Mini camera and microphone to everything on the Jetson, from one session.

The robot speaks WebRTC only. Frigate/go2rtc, the Live VLM WebUI and the Live Vision UI all want
something simpler, and each of them opening its own WebRTC session would cost the robot one H.264
encoder per consumer. So this holds exactly ONE session to the robot and fans it out:

    /mjpeg       multipart MJPEG, for Frigate/go2rtc (ffmpeg) and browser previews
    /still.jpg   the newest frame, 503 when there is no fresh one
    /audio.mp3   the robot's microphone as an endless MP3 stream (encoded only while listened to)
    /healthz     state, and WHY it is in that state
    --push-url   optionally POST each new frame into a Live VLM WebUI push session

The official Reachy app is a separate WebRTC consumer and coexists with this one. An on-robot app
that takes the camera outright, or the daemon releasing its media, is not an error: the bridge
goes dormant, says why in /healthz, and resumes on its own when the camera comes back.

Why aiortc and not the Reachy SDK: the SDK's WebRTC backend needs GStreamer's `webrtcsrc` from
gst-plugins-rs, which is not packaged for Linux and must be built from Rust source. aiortc is pure
Python. The heavy lifting is Pollen's own ReachyMiniStreamClient, vendored from their Home
Assistant component (reachy_stream/), so this tracks their signalling handling.

Why the answer is H.264 only. Daemon 1.11 offers RTX (retransmission) alongside H.264, and aiortc
(1.10.1, and still 1.14.0) mishandles an RTX packet: after unwrapping it, _handle_rtp_packet keeps
the RTX codec, so a frame completed by a retransmission is queued to the decoder as `video/rtx`.
The decoder thread dies with "No decoder found for MIME type `video/rtx`" and the track goes silent
seconds into every session. Leaving RTX out of the answer means the robot never sends it; losses are
recovered by the keyframe requests aiortc already sends.
